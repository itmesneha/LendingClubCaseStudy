# Project Name
- Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss
(called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender 
when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.  

- The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants, 
then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.   

- Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables)
behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## Analysis Approach
- Data Cleaning
- Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Results

## Data Cleaning
- Drop columns that had all null values or were not relevant to our analysis.
- Missing values were either dropped or assigned a relevant value.
- Duplicate data: in this dataset there was no duplicate data/
- Extract date and year.
- Outlier Treatment.

## Univariate Analysis
- Univariate analysis is the simplest form of analyzing data. “Uni” means “one”, so in other words your data has only one variable.
- It doesn’t deal with causes or relationships (unlike regression ) and it’s major purpose is to describe.
- It takes data, summarizes that data and finds patterns in the data.

## Bivariate Analysis
- Bivariate analysis is one of the simplest forms of quantitative (statistical) analysis.
- It involves the analysis of two variables (often denoted as X, Y), for the purpose of determining the empirical relationship between them

## Conclusions
- Many conclusions were drawn from the dataset and are presented in the pdf provided.
